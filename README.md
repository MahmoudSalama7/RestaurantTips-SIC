# Restaurant Data Analysis

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a restaurant's dataset, focusing on customer behavior, spending patterns, and tips. The analysis includes visualizations, statistical tests, and a predictive model.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights into customer behavior by gender, time of day, and smoking status.
- **Visualizations**: Various plots to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
- **Statistical Testing**: A/B testing to evaluate the impact of smoking on tips.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified and removed outliers using the IQR method.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explored relationships between variables using a heatmap.
- **Linear Regression Model**: Developed a predictive model to estimate the total bill based on other features.
